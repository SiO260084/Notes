Who would have thought that, globally, the IT industry produces about the same volume of greenhouse gases as the world's airlines do—roughly 2 percent of all CO2,emissions?
Many everyday tasks take a surprising toll on the environment.A Google search can leak between 0. 2 and 7. 0 grams of CO2, depending on how many attempts are needed to get the "right" answer. To deliver resuls to its users quickly,then, Google has to maintain vast data centres around the world, packed with powerful computers. While producing large quantities of CO2, these computers emit a great deal of heat, so the centres need to be well air-conditioned, which uses even more energy.
However, Google and other big tech providers monitor their efficiency closely and make improvements. Monitoring is the first step on the road to reduction, but there is much more to be done, and not just by big companies.

在全球范围内，谁会考虑到IT行业产生和全球航空公司相同体积的温室气体，大约是全部二氧化碳释放量的百分之二？
许多日常的工作对环境带来了惊人的危害。一次谷歌搜索能释放0.2克到7.0克的二氧化碳，具体的量取决于得到想要的结果需要多少次尝试。然后，为了尽快给用户返回结果，谷歌必须在全世界维护巨大的数据中心。这些数据都存放在高性能的计算机中。在产生大量二氧化碳的同时，这些计算机也释放出了巨量的热量，所以数据中心也需要配备空调来控制温度，这又消耗了大量能量。
然而，谷歌和其它的大型技术公司密切地监视和提高他们的效率。监视只是节能减排路上的第一步，然而还有许多问题亟待解决，而且也不仅仅是这些大公司参与。
