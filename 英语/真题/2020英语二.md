# Translation

Translate the following text into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.(15 points)

It's almost impossible to go through life without experiencing some kind of failure.But, the wonderful thing about failure is that it's entirely up to us to decide how to look at it.

We can choose to see failure as "the end of the world." Or, we can look at failure as the incredible learning experience that it often is. Every time we fail at something, we can choose to look for the lesson we're meant to learn. These lessons are very important;they're how we grow, and how we keep from making that same mistake again. Failures stop us only if we let them.

Failure can also teach us things about ourselves that we would never have learned otherwise. For instance, failure can help you discover how strong a person you are. Failing at something can help you discover your truest friends, or help you find unexpected motivation to succeed.

# Answer

人生难免经历种种失败。但是，关于失败最好的地方完全取决于我们如何看待失败。

我们可以选择相信失败就像世界末日。或者，我们可以将失败看作是一次难以置信的学习经历。失败向来就是这样。每一次失败，我们都能选择从失败中学到教训。这些教训非常重要，它使我们成长，使我们不会再犯同样的错误。如果我们放任失败，失败就会成为我们的障碍。

失败也能教会我们在其他地方学不到的关于自身的事情。例如，失败可以帮你发现你是一个多强的人。某些失败能帮你发现你真正的朋友，或者帮你找到意想不到的成功动力。

Dear international students,

This email is a invitation. In order to let you acknowledge China more, I am planning a tour to the Forbidden City for every international student.

To let everyone enjoy this tour, I would like to address three tips, which makes this trip perfect. First, taking food is not necessary. Because there are rather diverse kind of tasty food around where we will visit. Second, fully charge your phone or take enough batteries for your camera. I bet you must be indulged in wonderful scenery and amazing constructions and taking photo compulsorily. Third, do not carve anything on anywhere, which is a commander that everyone must obey. For everything in that site is historical heritage, undertaking thousands of years' culture.

Answer my email soon, if you want to seize this chance.

yours sincerely,

## Answer

The pie chart demonstrates a survey result that university students' aims of reading smartphone. Bulk of students' goals are learning knowledge. which occupies 59.5% of all participants. The amount of students whose destinations are killing time or acquire information by reading phone accounts for 21.3% and 17.0% respectively. And 2.2% of students' aims are not listed in this survey.

Combining my own experience and the figure of this survey, I could conclude that the result reflects the university students' real status. On the one hand, students are facing enormous academic pressure. Because their grades play a relatively significant role in their prosperity. To score higher than the other, one have to run out of his energy to learn what he need as much as he can, in order to receive a better offer that can support his family's living. On they other hand, living in a world which is saturating fully of information, it is quicker than people's observation that the speed of society's development. So, eternal studying has been a common sense, not only students, but also others.

To sum up all, it is a good phenomenon that phones are mainly used to get information, which makes students grow equally in many respects.
