# Translation

Translate the following text into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.(15 points)

We tend to think that friends and family members are our biggest sources of connection, laughter, and warmth.While that may well be true, researchers have also recently found that interacting with strangers actually brings a boost in mood and feelings of belonging that we didn't expect.

In one series of studies,researchers instructed Chicago-area commuters using public transportation to strike up a conversation with someone near them.On average,participants who followed this instruction felt better than those who had been told to stand or sit in silence. The researchers also argued that when we shy away from casual interactions with strangers, it is often due to a misplaced anxiety that they might not want to talk to us. Much of the time, however, this belief is false. As it turns out, many people are actually perfectly willing to talk--and may even be flattered to receive your attention.

# Answer

我们倾向于认为朋友和家人使我们联系、欢笑和温暖的最大来源。即使这可能很对，研究人员最近已经发现与陌生人交流也实际上也能给我们的情绪和归属感带来意想不到的提升。

在一系列的研究中，研究人员要求芝加哥地区的乘坐公共交通工具上下班的人和附近的发生交谈。通常情况下，遵循要求的参与者比被告知坐或站着不说话的人感觉更好。研究人员还主张我们之所以对和陌生人随意交谈感到害羞，通常是因为我们认为他人可能不愿意和我们交谈而产生了不必要的焦虑。然而，大多数情况下，这种想法是错误的。就像结果表现出来的那样，许多人实际上非常乐意交谈，并且甚至会因为得到了你的注意而开心。

> The bar chart illustrates a survey on how residents in a province choose to exercise. Among them, 54.3% prefer exercising alone, making it the most popular choice. Exercising with friends ranks second, accounting for 47.7%. Meanwhile, 23.9% of participants exercise with family members, and only 15.8% engage in group activities.
> 
> This trend can be explained by several factors. First, many people live away from their families due to work or study, which makes it difficult to exercise together. Additionally, modern urban life often emphasizes individualism, leading to a preference for solo activities. Exercising with friends is relatively common, as it provides both companionship and motivation. However, group activities might be less popular due to limited time or organizational challenges.
> 
> In conclusion, exercising alone or with friends reflects the busy and independent lifestyles of modern residents. Promoting group activities could help foster social connections and teamwork.
