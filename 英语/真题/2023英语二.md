# Section Four

46. Directions: Translate the following text into Chinese. Write your translation on the ANSWER SHEET.(15 points)

In the late, 18th century, William Wordsworth became famous for his poems about nature. And he was one of the founders of a movement called Romanticism, which celebrated the wonders of the natural world.

Poetry is powerful. Its energy and rhythm can capture a reader, transport them to another world and make them see things differently. Through carefully selected words and phrases, poems can be dramatic, funny, beautiful, moving and inspiring.

No one knows for sure when poetry began but it has been around for thousands of years, even before people could write. It was a way to tell stories and pass down history.It is closely related to song and even when written it is usually created to be performed out loud. Poems really come to life when they are recited. This can also help with understanding them too, because the rhythm and sounds of the words become clearer.

# Section Five

## Part A

47. Directions: An art exhibition and a robot show are to be held on Sunday, and your friend David asks you which one he should go to. Write him an email to

1) make a suggestion, and
2) give your reason(s).

Write your answer in about 100 words on the ANSWER SHEET. Do not use your own name in your email; use "Li Ming" instead. (10 points)

## Answer

Dear David,

I have heard that you hesitate to decide which one you should go to. I am writing to give you some compelling suggestions.

To pick up one choice perfectly, there are three steps. Firstly, grasp your real desire from your heart. Do not be affected by others' gossip or choices. You are making a decision for yourself instead of others. Secondly, go to the one which you could understand best. If you have never learnt anything about mechanism, it is not a good selection for you. Finally, it is beneficial if the show is highly related to your major of university, which can boost your interests of your major.

I hope these recommendations could help you. Whatever you chose, do not feel regretful!

Yours sincerely,  
Li Ming
