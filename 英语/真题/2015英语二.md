# Translation

Think about driving a route that's very familiar. It could be your commute to work,a trip into town or the way home. Whichever it is, you know every twist and turn like the back of your hand. On these sorts of trips it's easy to lose concentration on the driving and pay little attention to the passing scenery. The consequence is that you perceive that the trip has taken less time than it actually has.
This is the well-travelled road effect: People tend to underestimate the time it takes to travel a familiar route.
The effect is caused by the way we allocate our attention. When we travel down a well-known route, because we don't have to concentrate much, time seems to flow more quickly. And afterwards, when we come to think back on it, we can't remember the journey well because we didn't pay much attention to it. So we assume it was shorter.

# ANSWER

想像一下在一条非常熟悉的路上开车。那可能是去公司上班，也可能是去乡下旅行，或者是在回家路上。不论是哪种情况，你都熟悉每一个弯道，并且轻而易举地完成转弯。在这类旅途中，很轻松就把注意力从开车转向了欣赏路边的风景。结果就是，在你看来，这趟旅途花费的时间比实际要短。
这就是熟路效应：当行驶在熟悉的路线时，人们倾向于低估路上花费的时间。
这种效应是我们分配注意力的方式导致的。当我们行驶在非常熟悉的路线上时，因为我们不必太多地集中注意力，时间就看起来流逝地更快。并且在那之后，当我们回想起来这次行程的时候，我们的记忆就比较模糊，因为我们没有集中太多注意力在开车上。所以我们估计的时间比实际要短。
