# Translation(15 points)

The supermarket is designed to lure customers into spending as much time as possible within its doors. The reason for this is simple: The longer you stay in the store,the more stuff you'll see,and the more stuff you see, the more you'll buy. And supermarkets contain a lot of stuff.The average supermarket,according to the Food Marketing Institute, carries some 44, 000 different items, and many carry  tens of thousands more. The sheer volume of available choice is enough to send shoppers into a state of information overload. According to brain-scan experiments, the demands of so much decision-making quickly become too much for us. 'After about 40 minutes of shopping, most people stop struggling to be rationally selective, and instead begin shopping emotionally-which is the point at which we accumulate the 50 percent of stuff in our cart that we never intended buying.

# Answer

从顾客进门的那一刻开始，超级商场的设计就是吸引顾客停留尽可能常的时间。理由很简单：顾客停留的时间越长，就会遇见更多的销售员；遇见的销售员多了，就可能买更多的东西。而且，超级商场有很多销售员。根据Food Marketing Institute的数据，一般的超级商场包含44000在售的商品，还有很多超级市场在售的商品还要再多百分之一。如此之大量的选择足以使顾客被信息吞没。根据大脑扫描的实验，要做如此大量的决定很快就使我们应接不暇。大多数人在逛了40分钟后就不再努力做出理智的选择了，取而代之的是情绪化地购买----即购物车里装了一般我们没打算买的东西。

## Answer

Dear Jack:

I am writing to thank you for sincere congratulation. When I received your letter, I was even happier than the moment I won the contest. And for another purpose, I would like to give recommendations about how to translate an essay better.

To be a qualified translator, three essential abilities are necessary. First and foremost, the vocabulary, which I would never stop to attach more importance to it, is an ability what you should possess at first. For the reason, sentences are based on words and paragraphs are based on sentences. Secondly, it is the grammar that helps you understand sentences correctly. Finally, the culture improves your translations to a higher level.

If you have more questions, write a letter to me.

Yours sincerely,

## Answer

This is a simple pie chart, which show us the proportion of five aims university students travel for. To describe the details of this chart, the number of Students who are travelling in order to appreciate wonderful scenery account for the most proportion--37%. 33% of students are  aimed at releasing pressure. In the contrasting, the number of students who would like to make more friends or foster independent ability takes much less proportion than prior situation. The rest respondents aim for unlisted goals.

From the chart, we could make some conclusions. Apparently, appreciating the scenery is still the mainly travelling destination. But, as we all known, discovering mountains and lakes is also a way of relaxing. Maybe some students who chose the choice of appreciating the scenery have aims of reduce pressure, too. moreover, we can deduce that many students are under pressure so that they need a way to help themselves to keep peace. 

To sum up, a relatively great number of university students shoulder heavy pressure. Is this a good situation for students who are still growing?

> The pie chart illustrates the purposes of university students' travels. Among the five categories, enjoying beautiful scenery ranks first, accounting for 37%.

## Answer 2

The pie chart illustrates a survey of university students' traveling purposes. 37% of students mainly aim to appreciate the scenery, which is the majority of all survey participants. The number of students whose goal is alleviate their pressure is roughly the same as it's preceding mentioned, which accounts for 33%. Only 9% and 6% of students who are in order to make more friends and foster their independence. 15% of students' ideas are not listed in the chart.

To explain the phenomenon, I would like to give some possible reasons. First, a relatively large proportion of university students are under enormous pressure, which may be from their academic studies, so that they make a decision to have a trip. Furthermore, perhaps, some students are also want to release their emotions, but they select another choice--visiting landscape. Because, apparently, a byproduct of appreciating landscape is just reduce pressure.

As a result, probably, our government should take measures to reduce university students' pressure, in advance to refrain the occurs of something bad.
